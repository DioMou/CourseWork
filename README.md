# Additional tableau related project
The project uses airplane data stored from AWS S3. AWS GlueStudio was used to perform ETL operation to get necessary information from original dataset. Result is visualized by Tableau, including a symbol map to show the distinct count of the airlines that the destination airport accommodates, a bar chart to show the count of flights between SFO and different stop-over airports, and a scatter plot with Stop-over Departure Delay at the intermediate airport as x-axis and Destination Arrival Delay at JFK as Y-axis. Filter has been applied in plot for better visualization.
